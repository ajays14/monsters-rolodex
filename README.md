### What is it?

Monster's Rolodex is a basic react app which utilizes Javascript's fetch API to get a list of names which we turn into "monsters." Each JSON object is scraped for the name and email, and then displayed in a separate card with a fetched image. The search box on the top of the page utilizes the build in includes() method to match inputted characters with the monster's name.
